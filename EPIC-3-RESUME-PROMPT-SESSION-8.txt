EPIC 3 - SESSION 8 RESUME PROMPT
================================

Read the handoff document: EPIC-3-SESSION-7-HANDOFF.md

CRITICAL ISSUE TO RESOLVE FIRST:
Photos are not appearing in the Gallery after upload. The user uploads photos, clicks "View Photos", but sees "No photos yet" instead of the uploaded photos.

INVESTIGATION NEEDED:
1. Check browser DevTools console for errors during upload
2. Check Network tab for failed API calls
3. Verify LocalStack (S3) is running: docker ps | grep localstack
4. Check backend logs during upload attempt
5. Query database to see if photos are being created

SESSION 7 COMPLETED FEATURES:
✅ Batch photo delete with confirmation dialog
✅ Select All / Deselect All functionality
✅ Download button visibility fix (explicit blue color)
✅ Photo highlighting after upload (blue border, 5sec fade)

CURRENT STATE:
- Backend running on port 8080
- Frontend running on port 8081
- Delete functionality working
- Highlighting implemented but can't test due to photo visibility issue

START HERE:
Ask the user to:
1. Open browser at http://localhost:8081
2. Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab
3. Try uploading a photo
4. Share any errors from the console
5. Check Network tab for failed requests

Then debug the upload flow based on the errors found.

See EPIC-3-SESSION-7-HANDOFF.md for complete context, code references, and detailed investigation steps.
