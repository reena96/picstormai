I'm continuing from Epic 3 Session 6. The backend cannot start due to PostgreSQL authentication issues.

Current state:
- Frontend running on 8081
- PostgreSQL running with MD5 auth configured and password set
- Backend fails with "password authentication failed for user rapidphoto_admin"
- Password verification from inside container works, but JDBC connection fails
- Presigned URL code changes are implemented but can't be tested

Options:
1. Nuclear rebuild with init script (RECOMMENDED - guarantees clean state)
2. Use trust authentication for local dev (SIMPLE - works immediately)
3. Debug JDBC connection pool (COMPLEX - investigate caching issues)

Please implement Option 1 (nuclear rebuild) to get the backend running so we can test the photo display fix.

Steps for Option 1:
1. Create init-scripts/01-init.sql with password setup
2. Update docker-compose.yml to mount init script
3. Run: docker compose down -v && docker compose up -d
4. Start backend and verify it connects
5. Test photo display with presigned URLs

See EPIC-3-SESSION-6-HANDOFF.md for full context.
